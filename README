README for Projects Repository

Akul Penugonda - sole author

This Repository contains the C# game I made using the XNA library as well as the port that I made to C++ using the DirectX Library.
The C# version is in the folder Flygame, while the DirectX version is in the aptly-named DirectXFlygame folder. 

Note that these folders contain every single project file, including library files (such as those from DXUT) and some assets. For examples of code that I definitively wrote, check the CodeShowcases folder.
